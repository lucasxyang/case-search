# chrome-extension-search

/* 
This is a basic searching tool used in pair with Google Chrome, 
which does not provide built-in case-sensitive string searching. 
This tool will search most of what is on the webpage, 
but it does not search dynamically loaded content, 
such as content in a side-panel where random Tweet would appear.
Neither does this search content that is non-textual but is visually-percived as text. 
In all, this tool can never be un-buggy. A seeamingly simple task is proved to be very hard.
Just think about it:  Chrome and Firefox fail at this on sites like Amazon.com.
